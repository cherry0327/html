And the fourth is the sugar-free category like Tropicana 100% which has no added sugar but real pulp, concentrate and water. While the fruit used in the pulpy juices is very much real, it's not necessary that it will be mango. For instance, apples are often mixed with really saccharine fruit like grapes to lend an intensely sweet taste to the juice. There might be very little mango, with huge quantities of cheaper fruits like beetroot being added.
